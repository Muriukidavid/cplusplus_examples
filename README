C++ EXAMPLES:
These are the c++ examples used by me while teaching basics of "systemC". They include use of classes, templates and features like inheritance,etc. A basic decoder example and some examples found in systemC books have been included as a start. I intend to grow these into a set of systemC starting-point examples showing how different features of the library may be used. Feel free to fork, add examples and contribute back.
